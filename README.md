# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! I'm Jeff Plewak, and I’m passionate about solving complex problems with elegant code and scalable solutions.

## About Me

I'm a full-stack engineer, currently focusing on:

- **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS, Node.JS)**
- API development and integration
- Advanced error handling, role-based access control (RBAC)
- Code splitting, Lazy Loading, Redux, and Hooks
- Docker and Docker Compose for seamless deployments

Recently, I’ve been building APIs that integrate cutting-edge technologies like **Perplexity.ai** and **BeautifulSoup** to deliver meaningful insights into website content, local SEO rankings, and more.
