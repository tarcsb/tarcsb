# Hey there, I'm Jeffrey Plewak 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a seasoned software engineer with over 10 years of experience. I code in Python and JavaScript by day, and... well, I code in Python and JavaScript by night too. But when I'm not turning coffee into code, I’m working on some cool geospatial projects and innovative tech solutions.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 Working on: [MyGeo LLC](https://github.com/tarcsb) – because the Earth deserves better tech!
- 🌱 Learning: Advanced React and Flask (a day without learning is like a day without... coffee?)
- 💬 Ask me about: Python, JavaScript, React, Flask, or the best coffee beans for coding marathons.
- 📫 Reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyplewak) | [GitHub](https://github.com/tarcsb)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once coded a solution to a problem that didn’t exist. True story.
